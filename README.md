# 461LProject
This is the repository for our 461L team project. 

## Project Plan: 
### R1-1:
The members include Grayson, Brock, Arjun, Tyler and Axel. <br/>
Sprint Velocity: Weekly meetings on Mondays in person at EER. <br/>
Collaboration: Github used for all coding collaboration. <br/>
Communication: Slack is utilized for updates, issues, and other communication. <br/>
#### Implementation Methodology: <br/>
Prepare: research tools to be utilized <br/>
Plan: division of labor -- role assignment, project assessment <br/>
Design: mockups, sketches, rudimentary implementation <br/>
Validate: unit testing, functional testing, integration testing <br/>
Deploy: release/publish finalized project <br/>

### R1-2:
#### Features: 
PoC delivered within budget and schedule constraints, with updates to stakeholders. <br/>
PoC will have front-end web app that allows user input and output. <br/>
PoC app will have an encryption mechanism for user and password security. <br/>
PoC will have mechanism for adding/accessing projects. <br/>
PoC will have a database for storing login details, project codes, and resources information. <br/>
Stable site that can handle 10 concurrent users. <br/>
Ablity to create account and login securely. <br/>
User information tied to login and kept up-to-date on server. <br/>
Search functionality, allowing users to search for specific items.  <br/>
Filtering functionality allowing users to sort by category. <br/>

#### Technical Debt:
Technical Debt: Initial baseline implementation will lack certain functionality at the beginning. We recognize that some of these features like filtering, searching,
and categorization will be implemented at a later point which will incur a technical debt. To offset this, we will frontload the researching of these aspects
while saving the implementation for a later date. 
To minimize technical debt, throughout the development process, we will provide adequate comments and perform regular testing. <br/>

### R1-4:
#### Tools:
Figma for mockups; <br/>
Python for backend; <br/>
PyTest for testing; <br/>
MongoDB for database; <br/>
Heroku for cloud deploying; <br/>
React.js for front-end; <br/>

#### Approach:
We are going to have a front-end and a back-end team that work together and communicate with each other throughout the project. Teams will check up with each other
in our weekly meetings and plan accoridingly as we go. <br/>
